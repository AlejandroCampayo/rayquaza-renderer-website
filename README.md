# Rayquaza Renderer Website

This website shows the results of the Rayquaza Renderer project, developed as part of the Computer Graphics course at Saarland University. It provides an interactive display of the features and techniques implemented in the renderer, including shading normals, alpha masking, postprocessing effects, and more.

## Website Overview

The website is structured to highlight the following:
- **Our Scene**: A detailed view of the rendered scene.
- **Our Features**: A breakdown of the rendering features used, such as normal mapping, thin lens effects, and signed distance fields.
- **Others**: Additional information and references related to the project.

The website can be accessed at:

## Code and Template

The website was developed using a template from Weebly, which was customized to fit the needs of the project. The code includes:
- HTML files (`index.html`, `features.html`, `others.html`) for the structure and content.
- CSS files in `assets/css/` for styling.
- JavaScript files in `assets/js/` for interactivity, including a modified version of jQuery.
- Images and assets in the `images/` and `assets/` directories.
